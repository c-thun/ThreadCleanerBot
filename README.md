# Thread Cleaner Bot

This bot currently only removes new user added messages in group chats. This is pretty useful for managing large groups. However, future updates can be looked into with more functionality like removing more annoying messages. The only requirements for this bot are satisfied by using the following command - 

pip install python-telegram-bot --upgrade
