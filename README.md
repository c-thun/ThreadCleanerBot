# Thread Cleaner Bot

This bot removes unnecessary status update messages (user added/removed, admin changed, etc) in group chats. This is pretty useful for managing large groups. However, future updates can be looked into with more functionality like removing all such pre-existing messages. Currently, Telegram API only allows me to delete new status updates and doesn't work with updates that are already present in a group. 

The only requirements for this bot are satisfied by using the following command - 

pip install python-telegram-bot --upgrade
